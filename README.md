# awesome-hep

A curated list of awesome high energy and particle physics software.

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

The focus of this page is on:

   * Software for doing high energy/particle physics _analysis_, since this is the area most in need of the discoverability that an awesome list provides.
   * Software that can be used _right now_, not development projects or unmaintained projects.
   * Software that can be used independently of any collaboration framework (except for the collaboration-specific sections at the end).

See the [curated list of awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) for an idea of what an awesome list is all about: lists of links to projects, arranged by topic, so that users can find what they need. If you want to add anything to this list (or remove something that doesn't satisfy the criteria above), submit a [pull request](https://github.com/iris-hep/awesome-hep/pulls).

Links to other lists of packages are in **bold**.
